# 🚀 AI + Flutter Learning Journey

Welcome to my public repository where I document my journey to become an **AI-enabled Flutter Developer**.

I'm following the [AI Engineer Toolkit](https://github.com/break-into-data/ai-engineer-toolkit) and applying each concept through practical Flutter projects.  
This helps me bridge the gap between mobile development and machine intelligence.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

As a mobile app developer, I want to build not just beautiful apps — but smart, helpful ones.  
By integrating AI into my Flutter development workflow, I'm exploring:

- Real-time image classification
- Sentiment-aware product reviews
- AI-powered wellness and mental health agents
- Voice and chat interfaces powered by LLMs
- Custom agents that execute tasks for users

## 📅 Weekly Roadmap

📌 You can follow my weekly progress [here](./roadmap.md)

Each week I will:
- Study a new concept from the AI Engineer Toolkit
- Build a small Flutter project around it
- Write down what I learned and link the demo code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Flutter (Dart)
- TensorFlow / TFLite / ONNX
- Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- HuggingFace Transformers / OpenAI API
- GitHub for documentation
