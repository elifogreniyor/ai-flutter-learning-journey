# AI + Flutter Learning Journey
This document tracks my weekly progress as I study the [AI Engineer Toolkit](https://github.com/break-into-data/ai-engineer-toolkit) and apply each concept through Flutter projects.  
My goal is to become a mobile developer who can build intelligent and meaningful apps by integrating AI.

---

## Week 1: Foundations
- [ ] Understand the difference between **Prompts** and **Agents**
- [ ] Learn about **Toolformer**, **AutoGPT**, and agent-based architectures
- [ ] Build a simple **Flutter + Sentiment Analysis** demo (TFLite or backend API)

---

## Week 2: Model Training
- [ ] Train a basic **image classification model** using TensorFlow/Keras
- [ ] Convert model to **.tflite** format
- [ ] Integrate the model into a **Flutter app**

---

## Week 3: Inference & Deployment
- [ ] Explore **TFLite** or **ONNX** for running models on-device
- [ ] Build a **Flask/FastAPI backend** for model inference
- [ ] Connect the backend to a Flutter app via HTTP API

---

## Week 4+: Real-world Mini Projects
- [ ] AI-powered mental health assistant (LLM + Flutter UI)
- [ ] Custom agent that helps users take daily wellness actions
- [ ] AI-enhanced recommendation engine inside a Flutter app

---

Stay tuned â€” I will update this roadmap weekly with completed tasks, links to demos, and lessons learned.
