# Week 1 – Foundations

This week I’m exploring the fundamental concepts behind AI agents, following the [AI Engineer Toolkit](https://github.com/break-into-data/ai-engineer-toolkit).

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- What is a **Prompt**?
- What is an **AI Agent**?
- Difference between **Prompt-based systems** vs **Agentic workflows**
- Introduction to:
  - **Toolformer**
  - **AutoGPT**
  - Planning, memory, and tool use in agents

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Prompts = single-shot instructions. Agents = goal-oriented reasoning over time.
- Agents can chain actions and use tools based on intermediate results.
- AutoGPT introduced ideas like memory and iterative improvement.
- Agentic systems can replan, adapt, and optimize toward a goal — more dynamic than prompt-based tools.

## 📌 Next Step

I will apply these concepts in a simple Flutter app:
- [ ] Create a **sentiment analysis demo**
- [ ] Connect with a small backend or use TFLite
- [ ] Summarize lessons learned in code comments
