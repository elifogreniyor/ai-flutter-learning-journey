# Week 1 â€“ Foundations

This week Iâ€™m exploring the fundamental concepts behind AI agents, following the [AI Engineer Toolkit](https://github.com/break-into-data/ai-engineer-toolkit).

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- What is a **Prompt**?
- What is an **AI Agent**?
- Difference between **Prompt-based systems** vs **Agentic workflows**
- Introduction to:
  - **Toolformer**
  - **AutoGPT**
  - Planning, memory, and tool use in agents

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Prompts = single-shot instructions. Agents = goal-oriented reasoning over time.
- Agents can chain actions and use tools based on intermediate results.
- AutoGPT introduced ideas like memory and iterative improvement.
- Agentic systems can replan, adapt, and optimize toward a goal â€” more dynamic than prompt-based tools.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Step

I will apply these concepts in a simple Flutter app:
- [ ] Create a **sentiment analysis demo**
- [ ] Connect with a small backend or use TFLite
- [ ] Summarize lessons learned in code comments

## ðŸ““ Daily Notes  
*Below this line, Iâ€™ll add daily learnings for each concept I study in Week 1.*
